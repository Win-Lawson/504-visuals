The goal of this project is to create an interactive visualization of various symmetry operations

symmetry.py is the main file. It uses the vedo library to plot various shapes and their corresponding point clouds.

The user can left click any of the red points to select it. Afterwords the user can click the N_folds button to set a rotation angle 2pi/n-fold

Clicking the rot on selected point button applys the n-fold rotation about the axis defined by the origin and the selected point.
